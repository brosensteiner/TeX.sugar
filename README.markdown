# TeX.sugar

TeX sugar for MacRabbitÂ´s Espresso. The primary goal of this sugar is to be "injected" in TeX-style macropackages like a LaTeX sugar or ConTeXt sugar. Therefor it contains all TeX commands for code-sense and syntax highlighting (325!). The sugar is designed for flexible injections of its zones/collections (TeX units, TeX comments ...). Plain TeX commands will maybe come in the future ... 
If someone has suggestions or questions please let me know and [email me](mailto:brosensteiner@gmail.com)


## Installation

Type the following in terminal:

```bash
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Sugars
    git clone git://github.com/brosensteiner/TeX.sugar.git
```
